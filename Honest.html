                <ol>
                    <li>Be open and honest with yourself: To become an honest person, you must first be honest with yourself. Evaluate your own thoughts and behaviour honestly and admit your mistakes. Being honest with yourself will help you to be honest with others.</li>
                    <li>Avoid lying: To be an honest person, it is necessary to avoid lying. Sometimes lying seems like an easy solution, but in the long run it can lead to loss of trust and growing problems. Instead of lying, be honest and tell the truth.</li>
                    <li>Keep your promises: Part of being an honest person is keeping your promises. If you promise something to someone, keep your word and try to do what you have promised. Don’t make promises you don’t think you can keep, or if you can’t be realistic about what you can promise.</li>
                    <li> Show respect for others: An honest person shows respect to others. By respecting the opinions and feelings of others, you can build healthy and honest relationships with them.</li>
                    <li>Take responsibility: Being an honest person means taking responsibility for the consequences of your actions. Admit your mistakes and try to solve problems. Taking responsibility makes you honest and trustworthy.</li>
                    <li> Show empathy: An honest person respects other people’s feelings and needs. Empathy helps you understand others’ perspectives and enables you to build healthier relationships.
                    <li> Honesty as a lifestyle: Being an honest person should be a way of behaving. Honesty is important not only in relationships with other people, but also in business, friendships and family life. When honesty becomes a way of life, it is easier to do the right thing and avoid doing the wrong thing.</li>
